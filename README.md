# dimpred

This repository holds the code for the `DimPred` toolbox. To use it with models we fitted as part of our project, download the fitted models from the corresponding [OSF repository](https://osf.io/jtekq/) (download `files/data/interim.7z` and, after extraction, use the `model_...` of your choice).

A detailed how-to use this toolbox is in the making.
